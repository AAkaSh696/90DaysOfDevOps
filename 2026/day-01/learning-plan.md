# My 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level
I am a student with basic computer knowledge and beginner-level understanding of DevOps tools. I am starting from fundamentals and building towards job-ready DevOps skills.

## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is a culture and practice that combines development and operations to deliver software faster and more reliably. Cloud engineering involves managing infrastructure and services using platforms like AWS to deploy scalable applications.

## Why I Am Learning DevOps
I want to become a job-ready DevOps engineer and build strong practical skills in Linux, cloud, CI/CD, and containerization. I aim to work in production-level environments confidently.

## 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days
1. Deploy a containerized application using Docker and Kubernetes.
2. Build a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
3. Deploy a cloud-based application on AWS with monitoring enabled.

## 3 Core Skills I Want to Build
1. Linux troubleshooting and command-line mastery.
2. CI/CD pipeline creation and debugging.
3. Kubernetes deployment and debugging.

## Weekly Time Commitment
- Weekdays: 2 hours per day
- Weekends: 4–5 hours
- Minimum 12–15 hours per week

## How I Will Stay Consistent
- Daily GitHub commits
- Avoid skipping two days in a row
- Focus on execution over perfection
- Track progress weekly
